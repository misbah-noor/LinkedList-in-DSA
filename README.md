# LinkedList in DSA  

This repository contains implementations of various types of linked lists in C++ as part of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Each linked list type is implemented in its respective folder, with detailed examples of operations.  

## Contents  

1. *Singly Linked List*  
   - Basic implementation of a singly linked list.  
   - Operations implemented:  
     - Insert at the beginning.  
     - Traverse the list.  
     - Search for an element.  
     - Calculate the length of the list.  

2. *Doubly Linked List*  
   - Implementation of a doubly linked list, which supports both forward and backward traversal.  
   - Operations implemented:  
     - Create a node.  
     - Insert at the beginning.  
     - Insert at a specific position.  
     - Insert between two nodes.  
     - Delete a node.  

3. *Circular Linked List*  
   - Implementation of a circular linked list, where the last node links back to the first node.  
   - Operations implemented:  
     - Insert at the beginning.  
     - Insert at a specific position.  
     - Delete a node.  
     - Display the list in a circular manner.  

## Purpose  

The purpose of this repository is to provide clear and concise implementations of different types of linked lists for learning and future reference. Each folder includes a separate README.md file with detailed explanations of the operations and code structure.  

## How to Use  

- Clone the repository:  
  ```bash  
  git clone https://github.com/misbah-noor/LinkedList-in-DSA.git
