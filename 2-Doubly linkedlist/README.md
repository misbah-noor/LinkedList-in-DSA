# Doubly Linked List Implementation in C++

Here! I have implemented a *Doubly Linked List* in C++, it contains various operations implemented in separate files to improve modularity and maintainability.

---

## ðŸ“š Description
A *Doubly Linked List* is a linear data structure where each node contains:
- *Data*: The value stored in the node.
- *Next*: Pointer to the next node.
- *Prev*: Pointer to the previous node.

### Key Operations:
1. *Insert*: Add nodes at the beginning, specific positions, or between nodes.
2. *Delete*: Remove nodes by value.
3. *Traverse*: Forward (head to tail) and backward (tail to head).

## ðŸš€ Features
- *Dynamic Node Creation* for flexible memory usage.
- *Multiple Insertion Options*:
  - Beginning, specific position, and between nodes.
- *Deletion by Value* with safe handling of edge cases.
- *Forward and Backward Traversal*.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Overview
- *createNode.cpp*: Creates a new node.
- *insertNode.cpp*: Inserts nodes at various position.
- *deleteNode.cpp*: Deletes nodes by value.
- *insertAtposition.cpp*: Insert node at specific position.
- *insertBetween.cpp*: Insert node between two specific values.
