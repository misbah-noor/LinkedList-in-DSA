# Singly Linked List in C++

Here! I have implemented a *Singly Linked List* in C++, demonstrating essential operations with modular code.

---

## ðŸ“š Description
A *Singly Linked List* is a linear data structure where each node contains:
- *Data*: The value stored in the node.
- *Next*: Pointer to the next node.

### Key Operations:
1. *Insertion*: Add nodes at the beginning or other positions.
2. *Traversal*: Navigate through the list from start to end.
3. *Search*: Locate an element by its value.
4. *Length Calculation*: Determine the total number of nodes.

## ðŸš€ Features
- *Dynamic Node Allocation* for memory efficiency.
- *Separate Files for Operations*:
  - Simplifies debugging and understanding the code.
- *User-Friendly Logic* for easy modification and learning.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Overview
- *singlylist.cpp*: Basic singly linked list structure and initialization.
- *lengthofsingly.cpp*: Calculates the length of the linked list.
- *traverselinkedlist.cpp*: Traverses and prints all elements in the list.
- *searchsinglylinkedlist.cpp*: Searches for a specific value in the list.
